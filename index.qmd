title: "Useful Tools"
---

This page contains useful code, Linux utilities and tools that I use often.
These "idioms" (h/t to [Coleman Breen](https://github.com/cbreenmachine/wiscR)) are categorized by language (e.g. `R`), environments (e.g. `bash`, `PowerShell`) or other software (e.g. `git`)

Note: A lot of these are edited versions of code found elsewhere.
Sometimes they are exact copies reproduced in this repo for handy access.
I point to the source (and/or inspiration) in each idiom's description.
