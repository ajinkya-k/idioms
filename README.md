# Introduction

This repository contains useful code, Linux utilities and tools that I use often.
These "idioms'' (h/t to [Coleman Breen](https://github.com/cbreenmachine/wiscR)) are categorized by language (e.g. R, Julia), environments (e.g. bash, PowerShell) or other software (e.g. git)

Note: A lot of these are edited versions of code found elsewhere.
Sometimes they are exact copies reproduced in this repo for handy access.
I point to the source (and/or inspiration) in each idiom's description.
